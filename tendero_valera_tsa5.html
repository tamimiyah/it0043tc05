                Monkey D. Luffy, commonly known as "Straw Hat Luffy" or simply "Straw Hat", is the founder, captain, and
                strongest combatant of the increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates. He fearlessly pursues
                the legendary treasure of the late Gol D. Roger in order to become the new Pirate King and reach a
                further, untold dream (currently known to only his crew and closest friends). He believes that being the
                Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world. Born on Dawn Island, Luffy is the son of
                Revolutionary leader Monkey D. Dragon and grandson of the Marine hero Monkey D. Garp and as such is a
                carrier of the mysterious "D" legacy. Most of his childhood was shaped by Garp and Curly Dadan,[34]
                under whose care he befriended and swore brotherhood to the late Portgas D. "Fire Fist" Ace and
                Revolutionary officer Sabo. However, he draws his greatest inspiration from the pirate "Red-Haired"
                Shanks, who (unwittingly) enabled him to eat the Devil Fruit that turned his body into rubber,
                sacrificed an arm to save his life, and gifted his signature straw hat as a symbol of their vow to
                reunite someday, after Luffy became a great pirate.

                Roronoa Zoro, also known as "Pirate Hunter" Zoro, is a main combatant of the Straw Hat Pirates, one of
                their two swordsmen, one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, and is publicly recognized
                as the right-hand man of his crew's captain Monkey D. Luffy. Formerly a bounty hunter, he is the second
                member of Luffy's crew and the first to join it, doing so in the Romance Dawn Arc.

                Born in the East Blue, Zoro is the son of Tera and Roronoa Arashi, the grandson of Shimotsuki Furiko and
                Roronoa Pinzoro, and the grandnephew of Shimotsuki Ushimaru, making him a descendant of both the
                Shimotsuki Family of Wano Country and the legendary samurai, Shimotsuki Ryuma. As a master of Three
                Sword Style, a swordsmanship style which he created during his childhood training in Shimotsuki Village,
                Zoro is one of the three most powerful combatants of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy and Sanji, who are
                referred to as the "Monster Trio". His dream is to become the greatest swordsman in the world, in order
                to honor a promise he made to his deceased childhood friend and distant cousin Kuina.

                "Black Leg" Sanji, born as Vinsmoke Sanji, is the cook of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the Senior
                Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. He is the fifth member of the crew and the fourth to join, doing
                so at the end of the Baratie Arc.

                Born as the third son and fourth child of the Vinsmoke Family (thus, making him a former prince of the
                Germa Kingdom), he disowned his family twice, once in his youth and again after reuniting with them as
                an adult. After fleeing the Vinsmokes as a child, he eventually entered the care of Zeff as the sous
                chef of the Baratie, where he would remain until he met Monkey D. Luffy, who convinced him to join his
                crew.

                "Cat Burglar" Nami is the navigator of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the Senior Officers of the Straw
                Hat Grand Fleet. She is the third member of the crew and the second to join, doing so during the Orange
                Town Arc. She is the adoptive sister of Nojiko after the two were orphaned and taken in by Bell-m√®re.

                She was formerly a member of the Arlong Pirates and initially joined the Straw Hats so that she could
                rob them in order to buy back her village from Arlong. However, she legitimately joined the Straw Hats
                after they rebelled against and defeated Arlong. Her dream is to make a map of the entire world.

                Tony Tony Chopper, also known as "Cotton Candy Lover" Chopper, is the doctor of the Straw Hat Pirates
                and one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. He is the sixth member of the crew and the
                fifth to join, doing so at the end of the Drum Island Arc. He was temporarily forced to join the Foxy
                Pirates during the Long Ring Long Land Arc, but was quickly returned to Luffy's crew.

                Chopper is a reindeer that ate the Hito Hito no Mi, a Devil Fruit that allows its user to transform into
                a human hybrid at will. He was taught medicine on Drum Island by his two parental figures, Doctors
                Hiriluk and Kureha. Chopper aims to travel all across the world in the hopes of accomplishing his dream
                of being able to cure any disease.

                Chopper gained his first bounty of Beli50 after the incident at Enies Lobby, having been mistaken for
                the Straw Hats' pet. After the Dressrosa Arc, it was increased to Beli 100, then to Beli 1,000 following
                the Raid on Onigashima.
